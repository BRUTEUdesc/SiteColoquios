Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to `data-bs-`, as in `data-bs-animation=""`. Make sure to change the case type of the option name from camelCase to kebab-case when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use `data-bs-custom-class="beautifier"` instead of `data-bs-customClass="beautifier"`.

As of Bootstrap 5.2.0, all components support an **experimental** reserved data attribute `data-bs-config` that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has `data-bs-config='{"delay":0, "title":123}'` and `data-bs-title="456"` attributes, the final `title` value will be `456` and the separate data attributes will override values given on `data-bs-config`. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like `data-bs-delay='{"show":0,"hide":150}'`.
